It allows the admin to track the time and date of a specific task which was completed by the mobile application user. The application as well has a history page section where the admin can access previous files and their information by the search bar or pagination option. It has an integrated authentification system with the Mongodb realm. As well a built-in 15min automated fetch system which updates the current state with the latest data from the database
